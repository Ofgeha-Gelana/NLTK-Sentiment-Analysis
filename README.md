## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves analyzing textual data to determine the sentiment behind the text. This project uses machine learning models and NLP libraries to analyze text data and classify it into three categories:
- **Positive**
- **Negative**
- **Neutral**

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (tokenization, removing stopwords, lemmatization)
- Sentiment classification using various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Visualization of sentiment distribution
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Technologies
The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:
- **Python**: Programming language
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **TextBlob**: Simplified text processing and sentiment analysis
- **matplotlib**/**seaborn**: Data visualization
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
